# JC-s-Super-AFK
With the highest efficiency AFK!

-----

### This modpack is designed to minimize usage during AFK in the background

When you try to have multiple AFK players on a non carpet server at the same time, unable to place a dummy stops you.Also, the computer does not allow you to open too many games at the same time. Then you need this modpack.

This modpack aggressively reduces background usage by minimizing the graphics quality of all adjustable games (including those that can be adjusted by mods), while limiting background FPS, **allowing you to open multiple games simultaneously without causing lag**.

_When rendering 5,240 creepers simultaneously, the frame rate is still as high as 65FPS, but in the vanilla Minecraft, it is usually only 1-5FPS_

_When rendering 172,800 items simultaneously, the frame rate remains stable at around 120FPS, but in the vanilla Minecraft, it is usually only 3-5 FPS_

Tip: **This is not an integrated package for gameplay.** If you want to use this integrated package for normal gameplay instead of AFK, you will not have a good gaming experience.
